I'm very interested in demographics and the composition of countries.
In this notebook I dive deeper into the demographics of the USA and combine with voting data on a county level.
First we transform the demographic and voter data and combine them on a county level.
Then we create an interactive Bokeh dashboard which let's users run different Clustering Algorithms on demographic and voting variables.
The algorithms are sourced from SK learn, this dashboard lets you visually see the impact of the way clusters are made on a county level map of the USA.
To run this code yourself you need the following packages:
- Pandas
- GeoPandas
- Numpy 
- Boke
- Shapely
- SKlearn
